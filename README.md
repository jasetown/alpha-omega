# Classwork Progressions and Concepts

This repository is a **test repository** where I will be uploading various progressions of my classwork and associated concepts. The content here will evolve over time as I explore new topics and improve upon previous assignments. The primary purpose of this repo is to track my learning and document how I approach different challenges.

## Repository Structure

Each folder or file will represent a different concept or topic, ranging from small code snippets to full projects. You can expect to see:

- **Code samples**: Demonstrations of different programming concepts.
- **Class assignments**: Completed assignments with my solutions and explanations.
- **Project progression**: Larger projects built across multiple iterations.

## Usage

Feel free to browse through the different files and projects. Since this is primarily for educational purposes, the code might not always be perfect but will showcase my learning progress.

## Contributing

This repository is primarily for my personal use and classwork progression. However, if you have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or provide feedback.
